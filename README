Unlike in c++ where invoking the MutableExtension(..) method adds the
extension, I could not find a way to do this in python unless the extending
message has at least one field (like this: obj.Extensions[Msg.identifier].field
= ..)

There should be some way of forcing the message to be created (kenton@
suggested using the SetInParent() method but I could not get it to work).

These protocol buffer definitions were compiled with proto compiler v2.2.0.
